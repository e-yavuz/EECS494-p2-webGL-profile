<a href="https://wabito.itch.io/eecs-494-p1-gold-lan-emre">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a>
<div> This project involved me designing the dash mechanic, movmement system, new rooms, and the weapon and animation system. The technology used in this project include C# and Unity.</div>
<a href="https://wabito.itch.io/gundash">GunDash</a>
<div>This project was a rapid prototype of a platformer/shooter game named GunDash, wherein the player must eliminate enemies to traverse levels and eventually face the final boss to finish the game!</div>
<a href="https://wabito.itch.io/archeress-arcana">Archeress Arcana</a>
<div>A ~1 month development time, final project. Archeress Arcana is a 2D top-down rogue-like where you, as the main character, must fight through multiple stages filled with enemies and unique bosses. Cast abilities powered by unique runes with intriguing side-effects while upgrading and purchasing new abilities, runes, weapons, and more along the way. I developed the UI, rune-system, SFX manager, Shop system, combat interactions, and animations of the game.</div>
